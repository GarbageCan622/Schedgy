# Schedgy

1. To run the bot, first install discord.js and dotenv libraries through the command box with: 
   npm install discord.js dotenv

2. Download the repository and the enviroment (.env) file and add it to the bot folder. The environment file is not stored in our repository becuase it contains the keys needed to have the bot execute code. If this information becomes public, Schedgy presents a security risk to the servers it is in.

3. In a command line opened to the bot folder run:
   node bot.js

4. If successful, ready should be printed in the console log and the discord bot should be online in the server. 

5. Now you can run the bot's / commands in the server.
