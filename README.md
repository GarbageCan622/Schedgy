To Build
1. If you have node.js on your system (run 'node -v' in a command line, it should return v16.9.0 if node.js is installed). Otherwise install the latest version from the node.js site: https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Install discord.js with node.js, by running 'npm install discord.js' in a command line.
3. Install dotenv package, by running 'npm install dotenv' in a command line.
4. Download and unzip the repository wherever your like, and add the provided .env file to the root folder (the one with bot.js in it)
    IMPORTANT: The .env file contains private keys for using the discord bot, please do not store these in a public place, such as the repository.
5. Open a command line in the root folder and run 'node bot.js', and 'Ready!' will print if successful.
